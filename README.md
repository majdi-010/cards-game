# Guess Higher or Lower

## Context
This is a game I coded as an optional exercise for my Python course during my MSc Marketing Management in Rotterdam School of Management. 

## How to play 
The purpose of the game is scoring the highest possible score by guessing if the next card that will be shown is higher, lower, or equal to the current card. 

- If you guess correctly, you score a point.
- If you don't guess correctly, you lose a life.

The game stops when you exhaust all your lives.
